        <p>Twinklr is a modern music box: a physical, digital musical instrument. </p>

        <p>Instead of punching holes in paper, players enter notes onto a touchscreen. Twinklr makes it easy to write tunes in any scale or key, changing them at will - and any mistakes can be quickly corrected with a tap or two. Melodies can be saved into one of eight slots in the device.</p>

        <p>It allows the user to have multiple 'playheads' running at once, playing multiple versions of the same melody, leading to new interpretations of an existing tune.</p>

        <p>Twinklr can also control any other MIDI-enabled device, opening up new ways to play existing instruments, and allowing. </p>

        <p>Developed in collaboration with composer and designer Richard Birkin, Twinklr is a tool for performance, improvisation and composition, built using computer-controlled manufacturing techniques - and itâ€™s entirely open source.</p>

        <p>Twinklr is designed to be immediate and intuitive, but also a real instrument: something you can learn, improve at, and master. The short film on the right gives an overview of the music box's functionality.</p>

      <h2>Making Twinklr</h2>

      <div class='left minor'>
        <p>Twinklr is built using computer-controlled techniques. Its case is fabricated from laser-cut ply and acrylic, designed in CAD software. Its interface is built around a Raspberry Pi and touchscreen, and connected using a custom-built PCB. A focus of this iteration of Twinklr has been on making it easy to make more of them: by using readily available components and on-demand fabrication, tiny-scale manufacture becomes a possibility.</p>

        <p>All the hardware is open source, and licenced as as CC-BY-SA: you can download the lasercutter plans and the electronics schematics in EAGLE format from the Twinklr Github account. You'll also find the Processing code for the software there.</p>

      <h2>Open Source</h2>

      <p>Twinklr is Open Hardware; its code is Open Source. You'll find all code and plans for hardware on Github - along with even the code for this site.</p>

      <p>Why Open Source? Well, why not? Twinklr is built on a foundation of open software - like Processing, the Beads Framework, and Ubuntu Linux - and everything we've learned from building it has come from open sources. It only felt right to share alike. They are complex enough that if you honestly want to build one yourself, all credit to you; meanwhile, we continue to explore ways of building more for other people in the future ourselves.
